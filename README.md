# 🧬 Age-Related Disease Prediction using Medical Data

Our goal is to predict whether a patient is at risk of developing **one or more age-related medical conditions** based on anonymized medical records.
This project contributes to the growing field of **bioinformatics**, offering insights into early detection and prevention of age-associated diseases using predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Project Overview

### 🧠 Context
Aging increases the risk for a wide range of diseases and chronic conditions. Predictive modeling in healthcare allows early intervention, personalized treatment, and improved patient outcomes. Using a dataset of **617 patients** with over **50 anonymized health features**, this project applies machine learning techniques to help predict potential disease presence.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Records**: 617 patients
- **Features**: 50+ anonymized, encoded medical characteristics (e.g., lab results, vital signs, lifestyle indicators)
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification
  - `1`: Patient has one or more age-related diseases
  - `0`: Patient has none of the three conditions
